## Predicting Customer Churn for Bank Beta

### Description:
This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify potential churners among Bank Beta's customers. The primary goal is to help the bank proactively retain loyal customers by predicting churn in advance. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we seek to build a robust model that can accurately predict customer churn and provide valuable insights for implementing targeted retention strategies.

### Objectives and Problems:
The main objective of this project is to build a predictive model with a high F1 score (>0.59) to identify potential churners among bank customers. Additionally, we aim to evaluate the model's performance using the AUC-ROC metric. The key problem we are trying to solve is the need for Bank Beta to reduce customer churn and retain valuable customers. By predicting churn in advance, the bank can implement proactive measures to mitigate churn and enhance customer retention.

# Predicting Customer Churn in Telecommunications
## Project Description:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers terminate their subscription or service with the company. The primary goal of this project is to identify factors influencing churn and build a predictive model that can accurately forecast which customers are likely to churn in the future. By doing so, the company can take proactive measures to retain at-risk customers and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## Objectives and Problem Statement:
The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers at risk of churning. The problem statement revolves around understanding the key factors driving customer churn and leveraging this insight to implement targeted retention strategies. By predicting churn in advance, the company can take appropriate actions, such as offering incentives, personalized promotions, or improving service quality, to retain valuable customers.
