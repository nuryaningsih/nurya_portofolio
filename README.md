Hello! Glad to see you here. This is a collection of my personal projects focused on data science that I've worked on while learning.

# Exploring Trends in Video Game Sales
## Project Description:
In this project, we explore a dataset containing information about video game sales from various platforms, genres, and regions. The main goal of the project is to analyze trends in the video game industry over time, understand consumer preferences, and identify factors that contribute to the success of video games.

## Objectives and Problem Statement:
The project aims to answer several key questions, including:
- What are the trends in video game releases over the years?
- Which gaming platforms have been the most successful, and how has their popularity evolved?
- What genres tend to perform best in terms of sales, and are there regional variations in genre preferences?
- Is there a correlation between critic/user reviews and game sales?
- Are there significant differences in average user ratings between different platforms or genres?

# Optimizing Gold Recovery Process
## Description:
The project aims to optimize the gold recovery process for Zyfra, a mining company, by leveraging machine learning models to predict gold yield from gold ore. By accurately predicting the concentration of valuable metals at different stages of the processing pipeline, Zyfra can identify key factors influencing gold recovery and optimize its extraction processes accordingly.

## Objective and Problem:
The primary goal is to develop predictive models that accurately forecast the concentration of gold and other valuable metals during various purification stages. By doing so, Zyfra seeks to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its gold extraction processes, ultimately maximizing gold recovery rates and minimizing operational costs.

# Predicting Customer Churn in Telecommunications
## Project Description:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers terminate their subscription or service with the company. The primary goal of this project is to identify factors influencing churn and build a predictive model that can accurately forecast which customers are likely to churn in the future. By doing so, the company can take proactive measures to retain at-risk customers and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## Objectives and Problem Statement:
The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers at risk of churning. The problem statement revolves around understanding the key factors driving customer churn and leveraging this insight to implement targeted retention strategies. By predicting churn in advance, the company can take appropriate actions, such as offering incentives, personalized promotions, or improving service quality, to retain valuable customers.
